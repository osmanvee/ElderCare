  # ElderCare is a remote treatment environment for elderly patients
  The current number of people aged 65 or older is estimated to be 698 million people. These individuals have multiple comorbidities that would often need medical attention or some of may have mental health issues. However, with the current pandemic going on, the elderly are advised to stay home to protect themselves from the coronavirus.

How do these individuals see their doctors and have care provided for them? How can they monitor their medication usage when they are isolated without needing to neglect their autonomy for their own health? How can loved ones monitor these patients?
